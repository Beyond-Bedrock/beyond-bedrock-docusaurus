# Elevator Add-on V2

![Minecraft Title](/img/addons/elevator-addon-v2/minecraft-title.webp)

🔸Are you tired of climbing ladders every time you build a high building?

🔸Is using stairs make your building looks bad?

🔸With this add-on you can throw away stairs and start using Elevator blocks, but not any normal Elevators - they now can transform to any block, even blocks from different add-ons!

🔸These Elevators can do a lot of things besides transforming - they can emit redstone signals to make cool stuff and you can control the Elevators direction!
